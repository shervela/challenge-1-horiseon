# challenge-1-horiseon

## Description:

For this project I am to view the source code and revise the code to meet the acceptance criteria. The acceptance criteria includes:

1.  fix any broken links and add alt attributes to all images
2.  adding semantice HTML elements
3.  combine any common attributes and revise code
4.  make elements "responsive" so that the web application is optimized for  
    any screen size

## Installation:

Before starting the project, I created a repository through GitHub then clone the repository to a file folder in my Desktop. From there open the folder in VS Code. I clone the "starter code" from the assignment to index.html and css.style . After I have finished with the revised code. I "push" the folder/files up the my GitHub account. Then generate a working url website.

## Usage:

The navigation links are all working and will direct the user to specific section of the page. If any images do not load, the description of the image will be displayed on the page. Mobile query has been added so the user is able to view the web application for any screen size.
